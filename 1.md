# Cybersecurity &amp; Virtualisation: 1. Network Sniffing

## Slides

### Introduction
- Catching network traffic: easier with wifi. The actual catching that is, decription stays the same.
- When are you a [self-proclaimed](https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2017/09/27/vlaamse-gemeentewebsites-kwetsbaar-voor-cybercriminelen/) (ethical) hacker?
- Red (2TIN: Cybersecurity &amp; Virtualisation) vs. Blue (3TIN: Cybersecurity Advanced) vs. Purple Team: terminology originated in military CTF-exercises.
- Recap: CS1: The McCumer Cube
  - Security Goals: What is the goal of cybersecurity and how to protect our data?
    - Confidentiality: Who can see the information?
    - Integrity: How do you verify changes?
    - Availability: Can information be accessed when needed?
  - Information States, which are the sates in which (sensative) data lives
    - Storage, on devices
    - Transmission, from source to destination
    - Processing, in RAM during entring, adapting, calculating, exporting
  - Countermeasures, how can we boost security
    - Technology such as firewalls and encryption
    - Policies & Practice such as password rules
    - People using training
- Recap: CS1: Phases of an attack
  - Reconnaissance: Passive and active footprinting without being noticed
  - Scanning and Enumeration: Looking for weak spots in the targeted system
  - Gaining Acces: Actually trying to gain access though exploits or social engineering
  - Maintaining Access: Persistence through rootkit, backdoor, reverse shell
  - Covering Tracks: Deleting logs or hiding malicious code
- Recap: CN1: OSI Model
  - Physical: RS232, UTP, DSL, fiber, ...
  - Datalink: Ethernet, ...
  - Network: IPv4, IPv6, ARP, IGMP, ICMP
  - Transport: TCP, UDP
  - Session: NFS, SQL, SMB, RPC, P2P tunneling, SCP, SDP, SIP, H.323
  - Presentation: Compression &amp; encryption protocols
  - Application: Modbus, SEP2, HTTP(s), FTP, ...
- Recap: CN1: TCP/IP stack
  - Application: Data
  - Transport: Segments
  - Internet: Packets
  - Network interface: Bits & Frames
- Sniffing in this context?
  - McCumber Cube: Confidentiality &amp; Transmission
  - Attack-Phase: (Between Scanning and Enumeration &amp;) Gaining Acces
  - TCP/IP: Layer 2 Datalink / Ethernet

### IP Networks
- Devices
  - Hub : Acient L1 device which copies bits on all interfaces
  - Switch: L2, uses MAC lookup table to forward frames to correct interface within the same network
  - Router: L3, uses IP routing table to forward packets between (sub)networks
- Configuring IPv4-address
  - DHCP or Manual
    - 32 bit IP-address, public or private
    - subnet mask which seperates host bits from network bits
    - (optional) default gateway: ip-address of the device that can exit the subnet, often a router interface
    - (optional) DNS-server: ip of device which translates names to actual addresses
- Subnetting
  - Subnets traverse swhitches and hubs, but not routers
  - [Online](https://www.calculator.net/ip-subnet-calculator.html) calculators or [linux apps](https://netbeez.net/blog/linux-for-network-engineers-how-to-calculate-ip-address-with-ipcalc/) come in handy
- Relevance?
  - To visualise the network you are on
    - What is on it
    - What is near
    - Which devices are connected to the internet
  - To know what you are doing
    - What is my IP, default gateway, nameserver
    - whit what network am i connected
  - Know the commands on Windows and Linux
    - ncpa.cpl
    - ipconfig /all
    - ip a
    - ip r
    - route -n

### Sniffing traffic
- Popular sniffing tools
  - Tcpdump
    - CLI
    - UNIX-based, Windows-port: WinDump
  - Wireshark
    - GUI
    - UNIX & Windows
- Both tools use libraries to translate L2 to L7
  - libpcap on UNIX
  - winpcap on Windows
- Dumps usually used for sniffing, Wiresharp for analysis
- Saving results of a snif
  - .pcap-files
  - sometimes .cap or .dmp
  - can be opened later for analysis

## Lab

### Introduction WireShark
- Install Wireshark :
  - choco install wireshark
  - [Download](https://www.wireshark.org/)
- Demo: Explore [CSV - lab1 Wireshark intro 1 ICMP.pcap](labs/1/csv_lab1_Wireshark_intro_0_FTP.pcap)
  - 4 TCP-connections (Statistics > Conversations > TCP)
  - Each connection starts with SYN, SYN/ACK, ACK
  - 1 control connection (port 21): Follow > TCP-stream
    - tcp.stream eq 0: de commando's (login, cd, ..., logout)
  - 3 data connections (port 20): Follow > TCP-stream
    - tcp.stream eq 1: inhoud directory
    - tcp.stream eq 2: inhoud directory
    - tcp.stream eq 3: inhoud opgehaalde file
  - Passive vs. active FTP mode
    - Here: Active, port 20 for data-channel on server used &amp; server initiates connection (5000, based on PORT command) 
    - Note: Passive, random port (firewall issues possible) &amp; initiated by client
- Exploring a first trace file [CSV - lab1 Wireshark intro 1 ICMP.pcap](labs/1/csv_lab1_Wireshark_intro_1_ICMP.cap)
  - TODO: Try to analyse which command has lead to this stream of packets. Be as precise as you can be
- Analysing a HTTP capture: [CSV - lab1 Wireshark intro 2 HTTP basic.pcap](labs/1/csv_lab1_Wireshark_intro_2_HTTP_basic.pcap)
  - TODO: Is the browser running HTTP version 1.0 or 1.1? What version of HTTP is the server running?
  - TODO: What languages (if any) does your browser indicate that it can accept to the server?
  - TODO: What is the IP address of your computer? Of the gaia.cs.umass.edu server?
  - TODO: What is the status code returned from the server to your browser?
- Analysing a HTTP capture: [CSV - lab1 Wireshark intro 3 HTTP with objects.pcap](labs/1/csv_lab1_Wireshark_intro_3_HTTP_with_objects.pcap)
  - TODO: How many HTTP GET request messages did your browser send? To which Internet addresses (URLs) were these GET requests sent?
  - TODO: Have a look at packet 20. Which HTTP return code did you receive? What does this indicate?
  - TODO: Can you tell whether your browser downloaded the two images serially, or whether they were downloaded from the two web sites in parallel? Explain.
- A real world example: [CSV - lab 1 Wireshark intro 4 Real world Capture.pcap](labs/1/csv_lab1_Wireshark_intro_4_Real_world_capture.pcap)
  - TODO: Take a look at the conversations. What do you notice?
  - TODO: Take a look at the protocol hierarchy. What are some interesting protocols listed here?
  - TODO: Can you spot an SSH session that got established between 2 machines? List the 2 machines. Who was the SSH server and who the client? What ports were used?
  - TODO: Some cleartext data was transferred between two machines. Can you spot the data? Can you deduce what happened here?
