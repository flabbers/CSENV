  - Basic commands:
    - Ping (may miss systems blocking ICMP)
    - L: arpping (may require root)
    - W: arp-ping
    - PS> 1..20 | % {"192.168.1.$($_): $(Test-Connection -count 1 -comp 192.168.1.$($_) -quiet)"}
- Nmap
  - Network Mapper: Most powerfull open-source all-in-one tool that can discover hosts and services on a computer network
  - Multi-platform
  - GUI: NmapFE/ Zenmap
  - Features
    - Host discovery: identify hosts on network, e.g. hosts that respond to TCP and/or ICMP requests
    - Port Scanning: enumerate open ports on target (by trying to connect to them)
    - Version detection: determine application name and version number of network services
    - TCP/IP Stack Fingerprinting: determine OS and hardware characteristics of network devices
    - Scriptable interaction with target, using Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) and Lua programming language
  - Tips
    - Know what you are doing: OPSEC-safe
    - nmap --help
  - Commands to remember
    - Scan 1000 most known ports
      - nmap 192.168.1.22
      - nmap -top-ports 1000 192.168.1.22
    - Scan only port 22 for 100 systems: nmap –p22 192.168.1.1-100 (192.168.5.0/24)
    - Scan all ports on 1 system: nmap–p–192.168.1.22
    - Banner grab, connect with the service and try to find out what is is: nmap –sV –p22,80,443 192.168.1.22





## Lab: Nmap, HackTheBox and VBoxManage

### Port scanning

The goal of this step is to experiment with the ```nmap``` command from a terminal. We recommend using the Kali VM for this, as nmap is already installed inside this VM.

- Execute a simple scan on **scanme.nmap.org**. Which ports are open?
```code
$ nmap scanme.nmap.org
Starting Nmap 7.92 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2023-06-05 04:45 EDT

```

- Has ```nmap``` scanned all 65535 possible ports on scanme.nmap.org? How many has it actually scanned? How can you scan all ports?
  - Only the top 1000 ports were scanned (man nmap)
  - Our setup with NAT is not ideal for this ...
```code
$ nmap -p 1-65535 scanme.nmap.org
$ nmap -p- -v -r -Pn scanme.nmap.org
Host discovery disabled (-Pn). All addresses will be marked 'up' and scan times may be slower.

- You'll notice only TCP ports are listed, how can you scan for UDP ports?
```code
$ sudo nmap -sU scanme.nmap.org
```

- You are now probably waiting quite some time and no ports show up. Why? How can you speed up the process by only scanning for the 20 most common ports? How long does this take? Which open ports do you find?
```code
$ sudo nmap -sU --top-ports 20 scanme.nmap.org

- Let's go back to scanning TCP ports only. How can we detect which operating system and services run on these ports using ```nmap```?
```code
$ nmap -sV -p22,80,5060,5061 scanme.nmap.org

- ```nmap``` has support to run scripts. One of these scripts is the ```vulners``` script to see which vulnerabilities exist on the detected ports. See https://github.com/vulnersCom/nmap-vulners for more information. Which vulnerabilities do you detect for the SSH server at **scanme.nmap.org**?
```code
$ nmap -sV --script vulners -p 22 scanme.nmap.org

- **(Expert)** ```104.131.102.149``` is a server for a free open source game. Can you find out which game? Can you connect to the server and play this game (Remember, the game client is free)? Tip: this question could take quite some time (both from you as from ```nmap```).

### VBoxManage
VBoxManage is the command-line interface to VirtualBox. With it, you can completely control VirtualBox from the command line of your host operating system. In this step, we will experiment with some basic functionality of the ```VBoxManage``` command.

- The first step is to locate the VBoxManage executable on your host system. Where is the binary file stored, and how can you use it?
  - C:\Program Files\Oracle\VirtualBox
  - put it in your path or execute it from that location

- Which command can you use to get a list of all your VirtualBox VMs? Which command can you use to start a given VM (e.g. the Kali VM)?
```code
C:\Program Files\Oracle\VirtualBox> VBoxManage list vms
C:\Program Files\Oracle\VirtualBox> VBoxManage startvm Kali
```

- Change the amount of virtual RAM assigned to your Kali VM using the VBoxManage command, for example from 1GB to 2GB. Which command(s) do you use for this?
```code
C:\Program Files\Oracle\VirtualBox> VBoxManage modifyvm Kali --memory 2048
```

- Change the amount of video RAM used by the virtual display adapter of your Kali VM, for example from 25MB to 64MB. Which command(s) do you use for this?
```code
C:\Program Files\Oracle\VirtualBox> VBoxManage modifyvm Kali --vram 64
```

- Create a new snapshot of your Kali VM using VBoxManage. Which command(s) do you use for this?
```code
C:\Program Files\Oracle\VirtualBox> VboxManage snapshot Kali take test --description="Test snapshot of Kali VM"
```

- Delete the snapshot you created in the previous step using VBoxManage. Which command(s) do you use for this?
```code
C:\Program Files\Oracle\VirtualBox> VboxManage snapshot KaliLinux delete test
```

### Scan Enumerate Exploit
#### Setup
- Start by creating 2 linked clones that use the Debian (csvrouter) virtual machine as base. As a mac address policy you can choose: "Generate new Mac address for all network adapters" and leave the default checks blank for "keep disk names" and "keep hardware uuids".
- In the settings of the virtual machine, remove the second network adapter and change the first one to the host-only network adapter we created in lab 2.
- Go in the VirtualBox settings of the machine and change the mac address of the first clone to "DCA632DCBA21" and the mac address of the second clone to "000393AB12CD".
- Login to the clones and change their IP configuration to receive everything from DHCP.
- Stop and disable the DHCP, DNS and nftables services. Review the script of lab 2.2.3 of virtual networks if necessary.
- Perform the same actions on the second clone.
- Use your VBoxManage knowledge to increase the memory of clone 1 to 4GB.
- Boot all other machines (so as a total this would be: the original Debian csvrouter, kali, windows 10 and the two clones).
- Verify that all machines receive an IP address in the same network and are able to connect to each other (ping, ssh, etc should work).
- Install docker on the first clone, following the official documentation of docker: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/
- Run the following docker command:
```code
sudo docker run --detach --hostname gitlab-docker --publish 80:80 --publish 443:443 --publish 2222:22 --name gitlab-docker --restart always --volume /opt/gitlab-docker/config:/etc/gitlab --volume /opt/gitlab-docker/logs:/var/log/gitlab --volume /opt/gitlab-docker/:/var/opt/gitlab --shm-size 256m gitlab/gitlab-ce:13.8.7-ce.0

- Browse to the IP address of this clone and verify GitLab is up and running (note: it might take a while for GitLab to be fully started: it might show a status error code of 502 for a bit). Choose a root password and try logging in.

- Log in to the second clone and change the port of the SSH server to port 33 (use Google if necessary).


- Install nginx, ncat and tmux on this machine (use Google if necessary).
- In an SSH session to the second clone, start tmux. Type ```sudo python3 -m http.server```. Open a second pane by using the correct shortcut in tmux and run ```sudo ncat -lvnp 443```

#### Time to scan
- Perform a ping sweep using nmap with and without sudo. What is the difference? What protocol is used? It might be interesting to open wireshark in your kali to answer this question. Finally have a look at the mac addresses. What do you notice?
```code
$ nmap -sn 192.168.71.0/24

```
- The ping sweep command should give an answer on the question: *"how many hosts are up in the network"*. Now perform a normal default nmap scan without any options on the Windows client. What ports are scanned and open? (tip: use wireshark again)
  - None seem to be open
- An open port being does not necessarily mean that the service that nmap tells you, is the actual service running on that port. Nmap uses a default mapping for ports. First, perform a normal scan on clone 1 and afterwards perform a banner grab to verify the services. What do you notice?
```code
$ sudo nmap 192.168.71.15

- Do the same for the second clone. Take a very good look at the behavior of port 443 (have a look at your tmux shell and ncat command). Does scanning without a banner grab has influence on this port being open/closed. What if you perform the banner grab? This demonstrates that you should take care when it comes down to choosing nmap options!

- Perform a UDP scan on the csvrouter. What UDP port is open?
  - 53

#### Time to exploit
Our GitLab running in a docker container with a specific version is vulnerable. Use the Metasploit framework and figure out a way to successfully gain a meterpreter shell from your kali. If you have a meterpreter shell answer the following questions:
- Run the ```sysinfo``` command in meterpreter. What IP address do you notice? Is this the IP address of the clone?
- What architecture is the machine and what meterpeter architecture do you have (32bit or 64bit) ?
- Use the ```shell``` command to gain a shell. Try out ```ls``` and ```ip a```. What do you notice?

## Hack the Box
Let's apply what we have learned so far on https://hackthebox.eu . Create an account and go to starting point .

You'll notice there are 2 tiers: tier 0 and 1. Each has 3 free machines available to which you can connect. In order to connect to these machines, you'll need to open an OpenVPN connection to the network of Hack the Box by downloading and importing an .ovpn file.

To connect using OpenVPN, you can either use your Kali VM (which has OpenVPN already installed), or install OpenVPN (and a telnet client if needed) on your host system.

More information can be found here . If you still have difficulties, you can find video tutorials on youtube .

Can you solve the challenges of the following machines?

- Tier 0 "the key is a strong foundation"
  - Meow: nmap + telnet
  - Fawn: nmap + FTP
  - Dancing: nmap + SMB
- Tier 1 "you need to walk before you can run"
  - Appointment: SQL injection + gobuster
  - Sequel: MariaDB
  - Crocodile: nmap + FTP + gobuster
**Tip**: the starting point machines have walkthroughs available in pdf which you can consult if you're stuck. Look for the "Download Walkthrough" button.
