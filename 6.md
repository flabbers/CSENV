# Cybersecurity &amp; Virtualisation: 6. Static File Analysis

## Slides

### Recap: Process vs. File
- From binary to process
  - A program is an executable program, usually stored on a hard disk
  - Typycally a binary with instructions and static data
  - Executing the file copies these to memory -where processes have an address space- thus creating a process with also room for a heap and a stack
  - This is the process image of the process
  - It is referenced by the Process Control Block (PCK) in the process table of the OS, along with extra information
- Compilation
  - A program is written in a human readable program language
  - CPU's only understand their own instruction set
  - Translating process: compiling, which can go in severeal steps
- From code to hex
  - Often assembled before converted to binary
- Process vs. File
  - Process: running in memory and in a certain state (new, ready, running, waiting, terminated)
  - File, bin, exe: stored on disk and not running
- Analyzing processes (aka. "dynamic")
  - Difficult since lots of information
  - Involves analyzing the oparating system
  - Process is tricked by sandbox or tools
  - Debugger attached to a process
- Process Explorer (Windows)
  - [link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/process-explorer)
  - Part of the Sysinternal Suit from Microsoft
  - Task manager on sterois, with colors
  - Tree view for processes
  - Can gain information of running processes
  - Process Monitor more suitable for closed processes
- Analyzing files (aka. "static")
  - Only file access needed
  - Not running, thus safe
  - Simple: easy, analyze the bytes and interpret the results
  - Advanced: further analyze the behaviour by turning the file into assembly language with a disassembler

### Terminology
- Debugging
  - Used by developers to fix bugs and see values in memory
  - Intresting to analyze this debugging information
  - Sometimes comes with the file, sometime seperate .pdb
  - Debugger typically attached to the process
- Managed vs. Unmanaged Code
  - Managed code has to be executed in a specific runtime environment like tge JVM or .NET runtime environment, eg. Java, C#
  - Unmanaged code is allready compiled machine code, which makes it harder to disassemble, eg. C
- Disassembling
  - Byte code gets interpreted in assembly language to gain insigt in the program
  - CPU instructions and opcodes get analyzed
  - Different per achitecture
    - [IDA Pro](https://www.hex-rays.com/ida-pro/ida-disassembler/)
    - [IDA Free](https://hex-rays.com/ida-free/)
      - Linux:
        - wget https://out7.hex-rays.com/files/idafree82_linux.run
        - chmod +x idafree82_linux.run
        - sudo ./idafree82_linux.run &
      - Windows:
        - choco install ida-free

### Intro Malware Analysis
- Malware
  - Tries to do some malicous thing to your computer: trojan, worm, ransomware, spyware, ...
  - As a file, statically, does nothing, like in a quarantine
  - Intresting to try to capture known signatures in static files (like anti virus)
- VirusTotal
  - Hashes can be submitted on https://www.virustotal.com/
  - Statistics: Windows leeds

### Analyzing files
- File hashes:
  - Converts a given data inputstream to a fixed size output which will allways be the same.
    - Check the integrity of a downloaded file
    - Compare with hashes of known virusses (VirusTotal)
  - Windows
    - PowerShell: Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256 .\file.iso
  - Linux
    - GUI: gtkhash
    - CLI: sha256sum file.iso
    - CLI: sha256sum -c file.iso.sha256
  - [Howto](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/how-to-verify-ubuntu) verify a download: gpg, md5sum &amp; sha256sum
- Strings:
  - Shows all interpreted text (ASCII) from a file and displays it on the screen
    - CLI: strings file | head -25
- xxd / hexdump:
  - Shows the content of a file in hex format
  - Plain ASCII text will be seen as text
    - ssd file | head
    - hexdump -C file | head
- Magic bytes aka. file signatures
  - Most fileformats have a fixed header
  - [list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_file_signatures) of common hex signatures
  - Used on linux to identify the contents and to determine which program will open the file (<=> .ext on Windows)
  - Used by the 'file'-utiliy

## Lab: Intro to Malware analysis
When analyzing malware, security researchers fundamental goal is to figure out what a specific program does. It is research that is done in the **present**. The difference with **forensic analysis** on a system often lies in figuring out what malware did in the ***past*** and find proof, often called artifacts, on the machine. Another big difference lies in the analysis of one specific program (or program-flow) with malware analysis whereas in forensics the focus lies more on the impact on the machine and maybe restoring stuff.

In this lab we will focus on the first step of analyzing malware: **static analysis**. Before a process becomes a process, that runs in memory, it is a binary file on disk. With **static analysis** we will try to figure out as much as possible about a file without really running it. We will use our Kali VM to perform the heavy lifting and use common Linux utilities to analyze files.

When analyzing malware you should **always** start from a fresh and clean starting point, on a computer that is not connected to the internet. Take a snapshot and between "analyzing" files you should always revert to the known state without the malware, since you cannot predict every little thing a certain malware does. In this lab the impact of our analysis should be limited to your Kali but practice makes perfect!

### Lab files
- Can be found [here](labs/6/material.zip)

### The very basics
Boot up your Kali VM and copy over a few files from your host to a target folder. We suggest a pdf, a Word (docx) file, an exe (for example notepad.exe in the system32 folder) and a txt file. Make sure there is at least a small sentence in all documents aside from notepad.exe. You can also use the material.zip file from Chamilo.

With malware analysis you always want to play smart and cheat a little. If other researchers already analyzed a specific piece of software/malware, just maybe they shared that information already on platforms such as virustotal. On Windows you can use the PowerShell cmdlet ```Get-FileHash``` to find the hash of a file. Try this out (on your host) on notepad.exe. Search the man pages or the internet to figure out a way to receive the same information on Linux. Go to the virustotal website, click on search and enter the hash. Have a close look at all information that is available, even without uploading a file and only entering a single hash!
- virustotal: sha256sum filename / Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256 .\filename
  - 236f5a0247ba02eab637157dc792ada4af59347b2f07ed754124e22280dc5258 => notepad.exe flagged ok
  - 23a7c1bb65e8b05a39aa2eab921217995f4624bf13d065bf0c0a6fb272719780 => pdf.pdf flaged ok
  - b3717efe2f034479e18ccb5f177aafd3e802400e3e6d9bc51685967f0ea96369 => textfile.txt no matches
  - 59e15c4346fddf03522039815de0d7863af720b4d31431f43ba6c3c327b1e52e => word.docx no matches  

Use the ```file``` command in Linux. You can even use some fancy bash tricks and perform file on all files in the directory in one go. How did you achieve this?

Is the file command able to figure out what type of files we are working with? In other words does it show you that the notepad.exe is a Windows executable, is it able to see that a pdf is a pdf and not a docx-file?
- file: file *
  - notepad.exe:  PE32+ executable (GUI) x86-64, for MS Windows
  - pdf.pdf:      PDF document, version 1.7, 1 pages (zip deflate encoded)
  - textfile.txt: ASCII text, with no line terminators
  - word.docx:    Microsoft Word 2007+  

Try to rename all the files and make sure they no longer have an extension (so no .pdf, .docx, .exe, .txt). Rerun your file command. Is there a difference? Why or why not?
- Same  result: in linux the extension is not used to determine what sort of file it is.

Every file is fundamentally a series of bits. If the file is human-readable, the ```cat``` command is used. Try to cat your word and pdf files. What do you see? Are you able to grep as well in these files? Can you spot the author in the pdf file, and maybe see what program was used to generate the pdf?
- binary files: grep with --text
  - cat word.docx | grep --text "settings"
  - grep --text -i "author" pdf.pdf
  - grep --text -i "^<" pdf.pdf  

To visualize things better on a bit level we can use a Hex-viewer or Hex-editor. The bits will be shown as hex-values. A common Linux utility to view a file in hex is ```xxd```. Another one is ```hexdump``` often with the option ```-C``` (have a look at the man page what this option does). Try to analyze your files with these commands and have a look at the first few bytes. You can always use some previous learned Linux-knowledge (```tail```, ```head```, ```less```) to be more efficient.
- xxd / hexdump -C
  - xxd file | head
  - hexdump -C file | head  
  - 
Some recap questions
  - 4 bits in a hex number
  - 8 bits in a byte
  - => 2 hex numbers in a byte
  - 0x1A = 1 * 16^1 + 10 * 16^0 = 26
    - man ascii
    - man unicode
    - man utf-8
  
### Strings all the things
The ```cat``` command tries to print all bits to the console interpreted as text. In a lot of cases this is not possible and we get weird characters, they may even break our command prompt! The ```strings``` command is a tool that is a bit more intelligent. It will only print the characters that are considered readable or rather **printable**. Have a look at the man page. How long does a series of characters need to be, in order to be printed by ```strings``` by default? Is there an option to change this?

Try strings on your Word and pdf files and interpret the output. Is this a good format to grep?

  - length of strings:
    - -min-len
    - -n min-len
    - --bytes=min-len
    - Print sequences of displayable characters that are at least min-len characters long. If not specified a default minimum length of 4 is used. The distinction between displayable and non-displayable characters depends upon the setting of the -e and -U options. Sequences are always terminated at control characters such as new-line and carriage-return, but not the tab character.
    - [-e encoding] [--encoding=encoding]
    - [-U method] [--unicode=method]

### Magic bytes &amp; header of files (file formats)
Download, using the ```wget``` tool, the following image to your kali: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/18/Batman_logo.jpg and name it batman.jpg (this can be done in one go with the correct option for wget). Use the ```file``` command on the downloaded image. Is ```file``` able to figure out what type of file this jpg is?
- wget https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/18/Batman_logo.jpg -O batman.jpg
- file batman.jpg
  - batman.jpg: JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01, resolution (DPI), density 72x72, segment length 16, Exif Standard: [TIFF image data, big-endian, direntries=4, xresolution=62, yresolution=70, resolutionunit=3], baseline, precision 8, 1024x600, components 1

Use ```xxd``` or ```hexdump -C``` on the batman.jpg file and take a look at the first few bytes. What do you notice?
- hexdump -C batman.jpg|head -1
  - 00000000  ff d8 ff e0 00 10 4a 46  49 46 00 01 01 01 00 48  |......JFIF.....H|

Download the following superman.jpg file: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3f/Superman-Logo.jpg and perform the same analysis as before. Is ```file``` giving a different output? Compare the first few bytes with a hex view as well!
- wget https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3f/Superman-Logo.jpg -O superman.jpg
- file superman.jpg
  - superman.jpg: JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.00, resolution (DPI), density 96x96, segment length 16, comment: "LEAD Technologies Inc. V1.01", baseline, precision 8, 400x292, components 3
- hexdump -C superman.jpg|head -1
  - 00000000  ff d8 ff e0 00 10 4a 46  49 46 00 01 00 01 00 60  |......JFIF.....`|  

Try to change the comment "LEAD Technologies Inc. V1.01" to "AAAA Technologies". Save the result as a new file and try to open it to verify that the image itself has not changed. Tip: You will have to save the hex format of the file, change it in an editor like nano or vim, and retransform it into a binary from the hexdump. Maybe ```xxd``` has an option for that? If this works, nice job, you just performed your first binary hacking!
- cp superman.jpg superlucasjpg                                                                 
  - cat superlucas.jpg | sed 's/LEAD Technologies Inc. V1.01/Flabbers Inc. v7.09012345678/g' > superlucasaa.jpg
  - sed -i 's/LEAD Technologies Inc. V1.01/AAAA Technologies Inc. V1.01/g'
  - do **NOT** change the number of characters > error
- cp superman.jpg superlisa.jpg
  - xxd superlisa.jpg > superlisa.hex
  - nano superlisa.hex
  - Change to 41 (A in Hex)
  - xxd -r superlisa.hex > superlisa.jpg
- sudo apt install hexedit

### Analyzing binaries
#### Evil
Try to analyze the ***Evil*** file. What type of file is this? Use the ```file``` command and try to figure out the meaning of "dynamically linked" and "not stripped". Use Google if necessary.
```code
$ file evil 
evil: ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=62a4a80cf7608d59c816359567d63856c1432648, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, not stripped
$ ldd evil   
        linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007ffe1ebdf000)
        libc.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x00007f854958b000)
        /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007f8549785000)
```
- Static linking: If an executable is statically linked, it means that all the libraries it requires are included within the executable file itself. This results in a larger executable file size but ensures that the program can run independently without relying on external libraries.
- Dynamic linking: If an executable is dynamically linked, it means that it relies on external shared libraries to provide certain functionality. The necessary libraries are not included within the executable file itself but are referenced dynamically during runtime. This allows multiple programs to share the same libraries, reducing the overall disk space required. However, it means that the executable requires the specific libraries to be present on the system at runtime.
- In the compilation process of a program, the resulting executable file typically contains additional information that aids in debugging and analysis, such as symbol names, source code references, and line numbers. This additional information is useful for developers during the debugging process but is not necessary for the normal execution of the program. Stripping an executable refers to the process of removing this additional debugging and symbol information, resulting in a smaller file size. The stripped executable contains only the essential code required for execution, without the additional debugging details.

Because this is an executable file on Linux, one could use the ```readelf``` utility with an option to show all information. Try to explore the results in search of a certain shared library. Can you also figure out where this shared library is located on you Kali machine?
```code
$ readelf -a evil | grep -i shared
 0x0000000000000001 (NEEDED)             Shared library: [libc.so.6]

$ sudo find / -name "libc.so.6" 2>/dev/null
/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6
/usr/lib32/libc.so.6
```

Use your newly friend ```strings``` and run the binary afterwards. Do you spot something fishy in the output of ```strings``` that doesn't pop up in the output of binary?
```code
https://H
evilwebsH
ite.com/H
malware.H
[]A\A]A^A_
Hello World!
```

#### Keys
No hints this time... Try to figure out what the keys binary does and see if you can "hack" your way in.
```code
$ strings keys | grep -i hogent 
AAAA-HOGENT-753
159-HOGENT-BBB
HOGENT-CCC-058

$ ./keys                       
Please insert a valid key:
AAAA-HOGENT-753
Key correct!
```
### Manipulate files on a byte level
The ```Kdd``` utility is considered to be one of the most powerful tools in existence. It is possible to create and convert files from other files or create backups. Since everything in Linux **IS** a file the options are endless.

Take a look at the following ```dd``` one-liners , without running, and try to figure out what they do:

- ```sudo dd if=/dev/sda bs=512 count=1 of=mbr.img```
  - Create a backup from the first 512 bytes of the sda partition --> backup of the mbr
- ```sudo dd if=/dev/cdrom of=/mycd.iso```
  - Create a backup from a file/cdrom
- ```sudo dd if=/dev/zero bs=1M of=/dev/sdx``` (with x for example a: /dev/sda)
  - Wiping a device

Now take a look at the following one-liner and do run it: ```dd if=/dev/zero of=file bs=1024K count=500```. Analyze the file: how big is it, what are the contents?
```code
$ dd if=/dev/zero of=file bs=1024K count=500
500+0 records in
500+0 records out
524288000 bytes (524 MB, 500 MiB) copied, 0.662834 s, 791 MB/s

$ ls -alh file   
-rw-r--r-- 1 osboxes osboxes 500M Jun  3 19:18 file

─$ xxd file | head -1
00000000: 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000  ................
```

Create a file, using dd, that writes 100 random bytes in a file.
```code
$ dd if=/dev/urandom of=randomfile bs=1 count=100
100+0 records in
100+0 records out
100 bytes copied, 0.000374426 s, 267 kB/s

$ hexdump -C randomfile               
00000000  98 ff ed ae 6a 06 24 06  05 dd 98 25 22 ed 8b 91  |....j.$....%"...|

00000060  0b d4 6e c6                                       |..n.|
00000064
```

Finally, try to figure out a way, using dd, to make a duplicate of a file but skipping the first 20 bytes of the file.
```code
 dd if=randomfile of=randomfile_skipped skip=20 bs=1  
80+0 records in
80+0 records out
80 bytes copied, 0.000229514 s, 349 kB/s

$ hexdump -C randomfile_skipped
00000000  cc 7f fd 6c 25 98 6d f3  9c f6 af f6 b6 be 74 cb  |...l%.m.......t.|
00000010  c6 74 a6 1c c7 eb 64 49  42 cd e5 3f fc f6 a2 da  |.t....dIB..?....|

00000030  6a 16 ba 7b a9 a6 15 ec  8b ee 96 bf de 83 19 ac  |j..{............|

00000050
```
The name of this export file in the model is a bit confusing, the last bytes are not skipped
```code
$ dd if=randomfile of=export_without_first_20_and_last_16 skip=20 seek=16 bs=1 count=80
80+0 records in
80+0 records out
80 bytes copied, 0.000223749 s, 358 kB/s

$ hexdump -C export_without_first_20_and_last_16                                       
00000000  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |................|

00000060

```

#### The final (and a bit harder) challenge
Use your previously gained knowledge from this lab to figure out the truth about the file "challenge". Go step by step and try to figure out what this file is. You might need to use Google or Wikipedia at some point.
- file challenge --> shows "data" :(
```code
$ file challenge
challenge: data
```
- strings challenge --> shows something weird: "hiddeninplainsight" but nothing more; we do see "rgb" (foreshadowing: if you would use strings -3 you would notice PNG as well)
```code
$ strings -3 challenge | head -5
HIDDENINPLAINSIGHT
PNG
IHDR
sRGB
gAMA
```
- xxd challenge | head --> we see the PNG!
```code
$ xxd challenge | head -2
00000000: 4849 4444 454e 494e 504c 4149 4e53 4947  HIDDENINPLAINSIG
00000010: 4854 8850 4e47 0d0a 1a0a 0000 000d 4948  HT.PNG........IH
``` 
- Think for a minute and zoom out: we see PNG in hex but file is not showing png, it says "data"? --> Why? --> because something is wrong with the header.
  - The first bytes (hiddeninplainsight) need to be removed
  - When closely looking at the header the 8850 needs to be 8950, see wikipedia for the header of a PNG file.
- Use the xxd, edit, xxd -r technice to change the 8850 to 8950
```code
$ xxd challenge > challenge .hex
$ nano challengeb.hex
$ cat challenge.hex | head -2   
00000000: 4849 4444 454e 494e 504c 4149 4e53 4947  HIDDENINPLAINSIG
00000010: 4854 8950 4e47 0d0a 1a0a 0000 000d 4948  HT.PNG........IH
$ xxd -r challenge.hex > challenge
$ xxd challenge | head -2          
00000000: 4849 4444 454e 494e 504c 4149 4e53 4947  HIDDENINPLAINSIG
00000010: 4854 8950 4e47 0d0a 1a0a 0000 000d 4948  HT.PNG........IH
```
- Use dd to skip the first 18 bytes: dd if=c of=solved bs=1 skip=18
```code
$ dd if=challengebis of=solved bs=1 skip=18
7166+0 records in
7166+0 records out
7166 bytes (7.2 kB, 7.0 KiB) copied, 0.0104428 s, 686 kB/s
